# A brief explanation...

Open Source:

Most open source licenses follow the same principles, and this is not by chance. These principles are:

1. Software can be modified, used commercially, and distributed.
2. Software can be modified and used privately.
3. License and rights must be included in the software.
4. Software authors make no warranties.

All of them have one important thing in common: The Open Source Initiative (OSI) has approved them. OSI is an organization founded in 1998 with the goal of defining what open source means.

## GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPLv3)

This is the option for those who want to leave their code open but at the same time want security. Of the most famous, this is the most restrictive license. Its main rules are

* The source code must mandatorily be public whenever a software distribution is made. That is, if you release a product which is a modification of such a project, you must make your code public as well.
* Modifications of the software must be released under the same license.
* Changes made to the source code must be documented.
* If patented material is used in the creation of the software, it grants the users the right to use it. If the user sues anyone with the use of the patented material, they will lose the right to use the software.

Some famous projects with this license are [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) e [Linux](https://us-linux.org/) (GPLv2).

## Apache License 2.0

This license already offers users a lot more flexibility. This is because

* The source code does not necessarily have to be public when the software is distributed.
* Modifications can be released under any license.
* Changes made to the source code need to be documented.
* Provides the same patent usage protection as the GPLv3 we saw above.
* It explicitly forbids the use of trademark names found in the project.

Some famous projects with this license are [Android](https://www.android.com/), [Apache](https://www.apache.org/) e [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)..

## Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)

This is the license that React was adopting until then. It has two main versions: 2-clause and 3-clause. Let's take a look at what it offers:

* The source code does not necessarily have to be public when the software is distributed.
* Modifications can be released under any license.
* Changes made to the source code do not need to be documented.
* It has no position on the use of patents.
* The license and usage rights need to be included in the documentation of the compiled version of the source code.
* BSD 3-clause states that the names of authors and contributors may not be used to promote products derived from the software without explicit permission.

Some famous projects with this license are [Go](https://golang.org/), [Pure.css](https://purecss.io/) e [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/).

## MIT License

Finally, the MIT license. Of all those we have listed, it is the most permissive of all, and also the most famous. Compared to the others, it offers very little protection to software authors. Let us take a look at the main clauses:

* The source code does not necessarily have to be public when the software is distributed.
* Modifications can be released under any license.
* Changes made to the source code do not need to be documented.
* It has no position regarding the use of patents.

One great project with this license is the [Training Center](https://github.com/training-center)! Besides that there are other famous ones like: [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).

## Boost License

How is the Boost license different from the [GNU General Public License](https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php) (GPL)? The Boost license permits the creation of derivative works for any use with no legal requirement to release your source code. Other differences include Boost not requiring reproduction of copyright messages for object code redistribution, and the fact that the Boost license is not "viral": if you distribute your own code along with some Boost code, the Boost license applies only to the Boost code (and modified versions thereof); you are free to license your own code under any terms you like. The GPL is also much longer, and thus may be harder to understand.
